A small Flappy Bird clone built with p5.js. The project uses p5.js v1.10.0 and p5.sound v1.0.1 (both included in the `libraries` folder).

## Running the Game

No build step is required. Simply open `index.html` in your browser or serve the project locally with a web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Installing Dependencies

All JavaScript dependencies are already bundled in the `libraries` directory, so nothing needs to be installed.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – loads all scripts and assets
- `src/` – game source files
- `sketch.js` – sets up the game
- `assets/` – images and fonts used in the game

Enjoy flapping!
